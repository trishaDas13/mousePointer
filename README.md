<h2>HTML code description:</h2>

div class="container": This div element contains all the content on the web page. It acts as a container for the elements within the page.

div class="content": Inside the container, there's another div element with the class "content." This is where you plan to display the mouse cursor's X and Y positions in pixels.

Two p elements: Inside the "content" div, there are two p elements. These elements serve as placeholders for displaying the X and Y positions of the mouse cursor. However, the actual values are going to be updated dynamically using JavaScript.

div id="pointerCount": This div element has the ID "pointerCount." It contains two child div elements, "div1" and "div2." These child div elements are used to display the actual X and Y positions of the mouse cursor.

div id="div1"0/div and div id="div2"0/div: These two child div elements initially contain the text "0," representing the initial X and Y positions of the mouse cursor.

script src="./script.js"/script: This line links an external JavaScript file called "script.js" to the HTML page. This JavaScript file is expected to contain the code that updates the X and Y positions of the mouse cursor and displays them in the "div1" and "div2" elements.

<h2>CSS code description:</h2>

The universal selector * is used to select all elements on the page and apply the following styles to them:

margin: 0; removes any margin space around elements.
padding: 0; removes any padding within elements.
box-sizing: border-box; sets the box-sizing model to border-box, which ensures that padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height.

The body element is being styled:

height: 100vh; sets the height of the body to be 100% of the viewport height.
display: flex; uses flexbox for layout.
justify-content: center; horizontally centers its child elements.
align-items: center; vertically centers its child elements.
background-color: rgb(0,0,139); sets the background color to a shade of blue.

The .container class styles a container element within the body:

width: 550px; sets the width of the container to 550 pixels.
padding: 1rem; adds padding inside the container.
The .content class styles a content section within the container:

color: white; sets the text color to white.
display: flex; uses flexbox for layout.
justify-content: space-around; evenly distributes child elements horizontally with space around them.

The #pointerCount element is styled:

display: flex; uses flexbox for layout.
justify-content: space-around; evenly distributes child elements horizontally with space around them.
margin: 1rem 0; adds margin above and below the element.

The #div1 and #div2 elements within #pointerCount are styled similarly:

width: 180px; sets the width of these elements to 180 pixels.
height: 110px; sets the height of these elements to 110 pixels.
border: 1px solid white; adds a white border with a 1-pixel width.
color: white; sets the text color to white.
font-weight: 700; makes the text bold.
font-size: 32px; sets the font size to 32 pixels.
display: flex; uses flexbox for layout.
justify-content: center; horizontally centers the text within these elements.
align-items: center; vertically centers the text within these elements.

<h2>JS code description:</h2>

The provided JavaScript code sets up an event listener on the mousemove event for the window object. When a user moves their mouse cursor within the browser window, this event listener triggers a function. Inside the function, it updates the HTML content of an element referred to as pointerCount.

The content update involves dynamically creating two div elements, each with a unique id attribute (div1 and div2). These div elements display the current X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor on the web page. The ${event.clientX} and ${event.clientY} placeholders within the template literal are used to insert the X and Y coordinates, respectively, from the event object generated by the mousemove event. As a result, as the mouse moves, the content of the pointerCount element gets updated in real-time with the current X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor.
